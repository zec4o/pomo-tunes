# Pomotunes - Pomodoro Timer with Music 🍅🎶

Pomotunes is a simple and elegant Pomodoro timer application with an added twist - it allows you to choose between light and dark modes 🌞🌙 and even play some soothing lo-fi music in the background 🎵 while you work or study. This project is built using JavaScript for the timer functionality and HTML/CSS for the user interface.

## Features ✨

- **Pomodoro Timer:** Set a timer for your work or study sessions and stay focused. The timer follows the traditional Pomodoro technique, starting with 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break (that you must set). You can customize the timer duration as well.

- **Start, Pause, Edit, and Reset:** Easily control the timer with intuitive buttons. Start the timer when you're ready to work, pause it if you need a break, edit the timer duration to suit your preferences, and reset it when you're done.

- **Light and Dark Mode:** Choose between light and dark modes to match your preferred theme. Dark mode is perfect for late-night work sessions when you don't want to strain your eyes.

- **Background Music:** Enhance your focus with some calming lo-fi background music. Toggle the music on and off as per your preference.
